# Self Study Guide for Full Stack Machine Learning Engineering
This is a self study guide for learning full stack machine learning engineering, break down by topics and specializations.  Python is the preferred framework as it covers end-to-end machine learning engineering.


# Computer Science

Basic computer science skill is required for machine learning engineering.
